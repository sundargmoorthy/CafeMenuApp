# CafeMenuApp
This project talks about building a simple Cafe Menu application by using HTML and CSS. It gives brief idea about how CSS can be used to design HTML pages effectively. 
The idea for this project is taken from freecodecamp website (which I am currently using to refreh my computer skils), kudos to them. 
I am capturing my learning with this git repository so that I can re-learn it whenever required.
